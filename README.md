# Classify-Spam-Mails-With-Ensemble-Learning

***Problem Domain***

Email classification poses a significant challenge in contemporary information management, exacerbated by the escalating volume
of emails associated with digitalization and rapid technological advancements. One crucial preprocessing step in addressing this
issue is leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly in the realm of spam detection. The primary objective of spam detection 
is to filter out unwanted emails, ensuring that only relevant and legitimate messages are presented to users. Among the prevalent methods
applied to this task, supervised learning AI techniques stand out due to their effectiveness in discerning meaningful patterns and concepts 
from vast datasets. By training on labeled data, these models can learn to differentiate between spam and non-spam emails, contributing to
a more streamlined and secure email experience for users.

***Ensemble Learning***
In statistics and machine learning, ensemble methods use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone.

Stacking (sometimes called stacked generalization) involves training a model to combine the predictions of several other learning algorithms. First, all of the other algorithms are trained using the available data, then a combiner algorithm (final estimator) is trained to make a final prediction using all the predictions of the other algorithms (base estimators) as additional inputs or using cross-validated predictions from the base estimators which can prevent overfitting.

***Techniques Used***

Various machine learning techniques are employed in the realm of email spam classification, aiming to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the classification process. Supervised learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, have emerged as prevalent choices. Naive Bayes relies on probabilistic assumptions derived from past data, while SVMs exhibit robustness against overfitting, thanks to their utilization of decision planes rather than straight lines. Random Forest, as an ensemble method, amalgamates predictive models into comprehensive decision trees, offering improved performance by leveraging multiple models. Gradient Boosting adopts a strategy of utilizing multiple weak learners randomly chosen from diverse subsets, contributing to enhanced classification capabilities. Notably, the integration of ensemble learning further fortifies the classification process, with the incorporation of a stacking classifier featuring a logistic regression classifier in the stacking layer. Beyond supervised learning, unsupervised techniques such as clustering (e.g., K-means and DBSCAN) and anomaly detection (e.g., one-class SVM and Random Forest) play a pivotal role. These unsupervised methods, unlike their supervised counterparts, do not rely on labeled data but instead identify patterns within the data to effectively classify emails as either spam or non-spam, showcasing the versatility of machine learning in addressing the intricacies of email spam detection.
